# Springboard-Fruit-Search-with-Autocomplete
A search UI project from the Springboard Software Engineering bootcamp. 
## Requirements
When this project is done it will have the following functionality: 
* On-screen search bar with placeholder text
* An event-listener for keystrokes which will trigger the function search()
* * The function will filter a list of fruit based on user input
  * If the string in the user input appears ANYWHERE in the fruit name, it should be added to results list
  * It also should not matter if a user types upper or lower case letters
* The autocomplete results will be displayed as a dropdown
* On mouse hover, an event listener will highlight the suggested item under the user's cursor
* On click, an event listener will trigger a function called useSuggestion(), which will populate the search box with the user's selected suggestiion
* A stylesheet will define the search UI with a linear gradient background and a translucent background for the search bar which shows the background below
